1. Installation
1.1 Configure your Ubuntu repositories
Configure your Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse." You can follow the ubuntu guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu  for instructions on doing this.

1.2 Setup your sources.list
Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org.
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

1.3 Set up your keys
sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -

1.4 Installation
First, make sure your Debian package index is up-to-date:
sudo apt update

Now pick how much of ROS you would like to install.
Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended) : Everything in Desktop plus 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception packages
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full

1.5 Environment setup
You must source this script in every bash terminal you use ROS in.
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
It can be convenient to automatically source this script every time a new shell is launched. These commands will do that for you.
