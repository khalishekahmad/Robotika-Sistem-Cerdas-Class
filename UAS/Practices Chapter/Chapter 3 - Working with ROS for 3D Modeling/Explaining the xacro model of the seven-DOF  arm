After defining the elements that we must insert in the robot model file, we are now ready 
to include 10 links and 9 joints (7 for the arm and 2 for the gripper) on this robot, and 2 
links and 2 joints on the robot gripper.
Let's start by looking at the xacro definition:
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<robot name="seven_dof_arm" xmlns:xacro="http://ros.org/wiki/
xacro"> 

Because we are writing a xacro file, we should mention the xacro namespace to parse the 
file; then, we can start to define the geometric properties of the arm
