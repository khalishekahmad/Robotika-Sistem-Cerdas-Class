The following tags are the commonly used URDF tags to compose a URDF robot model:
â€¢ link: The link tag represents the single link of a robot. Using this tag, we can 
model a robot link and its properties. The modeling includes the size, the shape, 
and the color; it can even import a 3D mesh to represent the robot link. We can 
also provide the dynamic properties of the link, such as the inertial matrix and the 
collision properties.
The syntax is as follows:
<link name="<name of the link>"> 
<inertial>...........</inertial> 
 <visual> ............</visual> 
 <collision>..........</collision> 
</link>

joint: The joint tag represents a robot joint. We can specify the kinematics and 
dynamics of the joint and set the limits of the joint movement and its velocity. The 
joint tag supports the different types of joints, such as revolute, continuous, 
prismatic, fixed, floating, and planar.
The syntax is as follows:
<joint name="<name of the joint>"> 
 <parent link="link1"/> 
 <child link="link2"/> 
 
 <calibration .... /> 
 <dynamics damping ..../> 
 <limit effort .... /> 
</joint>

robot: This tag encapsulates the entire robot model that can be represented using 
URDF. Inside the robot tag, we can define the name of the robot, the links, and the 
joints of the robot.
The syntax is as follows:
<robot name="<name of the robot>" 
 <link> ..... </link> 
 <link> ...... </link> 
 <joint> ....... </joint> 
 <joint> ........</joint> 
</robot> 

gazebo: This tag is used when we include the simulation parameters of the 
Gazebo simulator inside the URDF. We can use this tag to include gazebo plugins, 
gazebo material properties, and more. The following shows an example that uses 
gazebo tags:
 <gazebo reference="link_1"> 
 <material>Gazebo/Black</material> 
 </gazebo>
