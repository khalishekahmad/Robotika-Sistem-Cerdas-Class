We can see that an extra GUI came along with RViz; it contains sliders to control the 
pan joints and the tilt joints. This GUI is called the Joint State Publisher Gui node and 
belongs to the joint_state_publisher_gui package:
 <node name="joint_state_publisher_gui" pkg="joint_state_
publisher_gui" type="joint_state_publisher_gui" /> 

We can include this node in the launch file using the following statement. The limits of 
pan-and-tilt should be mentioned inside the joint tag:
 <joint name="pan_joint" type="revolute"> 
 <parent link="base_link"/> 
 <child link="pan_link"/> 
 <origin xyz="0 0 0.1"/> 
 <axis xyz="0 0 1" /> 
 <limit effort="300" velocity="0.1" lower="-3.14" 
upper="3.14"/> 
 <dynamics damping="50" friction="1"/> 
 </joint>
