Before creating the URDF file for the robot, let's create an ROS package in the catkin
workspace so that the robot model keeps using the following command:
catkin_create_pkg mastering_ros_robot_description_pkg roscpp tf 
geometry_msgs urdf rviz xacro 

The package mainly depends on the urdf and xacro packages. If these packages have 
not been installed on to your system, you can install them using the package manager:
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-urdf
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-xacro 

We can create the urdf file of the robot inside this package and create launch files to 
display the created urdf file in RViz. The full package is available in the following Git 
repository; you can clone the repository for reference to implement this package, or you 
can get the package from the book's source code:
git clone https://github.com/qboticslabs/mastering_ros_3rd_
edition.git
cd mastering_ros_robot_description_pkg/

Before creating the URDF file of this robot, let's create three folders called urdf, meshes, 
and launch inside the package folder. The urdf folder can be used to keep the URDF 
and xacro files that we are going to create. The meshes folder keeps the meshes that we 
need to include in the urdf file, and the launch folder keeps the ROS launch files.
