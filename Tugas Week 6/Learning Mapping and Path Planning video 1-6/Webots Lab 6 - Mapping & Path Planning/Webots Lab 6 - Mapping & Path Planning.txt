All tasks: 
print: 
4x4 grid of already visited cells
[x = visited |. = not visited

the state the robot is in 
robot pose = (x, y, grid number, orientation)

task 1 - wall mapping 
objective map the internal wall configuration (map will not be known)
test - run it

task 2 - path planning with wavefront planner 
objective use wavefront planner algorithm to generate the shortest path from start to goal. then have robot follow path [start, goal and map are known in advance]

test start = 16 goal = 10
start = 16 goal = 6
start = 13 goal = 1
